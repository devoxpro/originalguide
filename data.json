You can even drive around after buying cars. If I were to list everything you could do in the game, it would get quite long but you just have to basically go around exploring. Daily tasks and rewards are also a part of the game while you can go out camping or have parties with your friends.

The game also has a day and night cycle along with rules you need to follow in the town, public transport and a bunch of easter eggs. One of the issues which most players have with the game is the fact that things like clothes are really overpriced and you really need to grind to obtain them. Considering the game is free it does somewhat justify the high costs but it would be better if items werenâ€™t so hard to get.",

    "Urltexte": "The graphics arenâ€™t anything special but are quite colorful. Because of the overall look and graphical theme of the game, the vibrant graphics look great. The sound effects do get a little annoying sometimes but the in-game music is not too bad. Overall the graphics and audio wonâ€™t give you too many issues.The controls are pretty easy to get used to. You can move around, look around and jump. The camera angle is above the shoulder and the UI is also pretty easy to understand. Once you get the hang of the options and the interface, the game would get quite easy. At the start, things can be a bit confusing but youâ€™ll get used to it.",

By watching ads, you can increase your resources while the In-App Purchases can make the game pretty easy for you since items cost a lot and you can buy in-game currency with real money.The game does have a few bugs and visual glitches but it is kind of expected from a game with so many different features and so much to do. Some of the races and minigames have bugs that place you at a disadvantage.",
